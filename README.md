# CssEffects
## My tour in the world of css.

I'll be explaining the design and aestetics of some cool css effects i've implemented.
The source codes will be released in this repo.

This effect uses transform effects while on hover, and scale effects while on active selector.

This effect allows you to show a user that the card is on hover (The website is responsive) and on active (That the card will expand into more details when the mouse click is up). this allows your user to have a geniune ux feedback on what's going on.

Note: on mobile websites this approach is flawed, because hover & active are toogled the same moment a user holds a card, and the user might want to see what'll happen if they clicked longer, which unfortunately triggers a context menu, a better approach is to not show any interactivity at all.
